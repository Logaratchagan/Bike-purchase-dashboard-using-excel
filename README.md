# BIKE PURCHASE DASHBOARD USING EXCEL

## The project is about bike purchase in different regions and related informations. I have visualized in the form of tables as well as charts. 

### I have got this dataset from Kaggle, it consists of information like ID, Marital Status, Gender, Income,Children, Education, Occupation, Home Owner, Cars, Commute Distance, Region, Age, Age category, Purchased Bike.I have cleaned the dataset and created different pivot tables in the excel & also I have created different pivot charts for the pivot tables. So that we can easily able to understand the data in a better manner. 
 
### I have inserted slicer in it for better understanding in the charts, So the option that we are selecting will be reflected in the charts. 

### I will attach the screenshot of each and every pivot table which I have created also I'm attaching the pivot charts for the respective pivot tables. 

### Finally I have attached all the pivot charts in a single worksheet and created a dashboard for visualization. I have used charts like (Bar chart, Line chart, Column charts) in this project.
